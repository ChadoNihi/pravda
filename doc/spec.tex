\section{Introduction}

As part of the Mytime Project, BSCE designed to solve challenges of the game industry in section of decentralization. The purpose of BSCE is programmatic management of global state of the network. We offering minimalistic  deterministic virtual machine and runtime library for managed execution of smart-contracts.

In our work we focusing on simplicity and extensibility. We don't set ourselves a task to invent something new but using solid foundation of computer science considering requirements of the network.

This document specifies memory and execution model, bytecode format, start-contracts interop and definition of standard library (including procedures and data types). Also this document defining gas-economy. The document \textit{doesn't} consider questions of blockchain, consensus, network of storage. 

\section{Execution model}

\subsection{General}

BSCE is stack-based virtual machine. All data represented with string, so "machine word" is string. BSCE can store words in a managed heap.Heap is inaccessible for raw reads/writes and fully managed by runtime. Heap has map-like interface where key is string of four bytes and value is an arbitrary string. 

Persistence is an integral part of BSCE which is representation of a global state of the network. As a heap, persistent state has map-like interface. Difference is programmer can use arbitrary string as a key.

Code can be executed
\subsection{Execution scopes}

Launched code is named execution. There are two execution scopes: transaction and smart-contract. If launched code placed in transaction it has \textit{transaction scope}. Similarly if launched code placed in a smart-contract it has \textit{smart-contract scope}. Every execution has it's own heap. 

Execution in transactions scope has not persistent storage but has it's own stack. Execution in smart-contacts scope inherits a stack from an execution which launches it. Also it has persistent storage shared between all executions of the smart-contract.

\subsection{Transaction isolation}

As noted above persistence is an integral part of BSCE. Executions can read and write to persistent storage. BSCE supports parallel execution of same smart-contacts. It means concurrent access to stored data. According to requirement we need to provide highest level of consistency so transactions is isolated serializable\cite{transaction-isolation}. 

\section{Bytecode}

BVM executes bytecode in the format described below. Every program is linear sequence of \textit{opcodes}. Any opcode is represented by one byte. Exception is "PUSHX" opcode which is represented by one byte for opcode itself, and a word to represent a constant.

Word is represented by 2 bits of word length and $6+8*(l+1)$ bits of data where $l$ is the number encoded in first two bits.
