\section{Introduction}

As part of the Mytime Project, BSCE is designed to solve challenges of the game industry in section of decentralization. The purpose of BSCE is programmatic management of global state of the network. We're offering minimalistic deterministic virtual machine and runtime library for managed execution of smart-contracts.

In our work we're focusing on simplicity and extensibility. We don't set ourselves a task to invent something new, but using solid foundation of computer science we consider requirements of the network.

This document specifies memory and execution model, bytecode format, start-contracts interop and definition of standard library (including procedures and data types). Also this document defines gas-economy. The document \textit{doesn't} consider issues of blockchain, consensus, network of storage. 

\section{Execution model}

\subsection{General}

BSCE is a stack-based virtual machine. All data is represented by string, so "machine word" is a string. BSCE can store words in a managed heap. Heap is inaccessible for raw reads/writes and fully managed by runtime. Heap has map-like interface where key is string of four bytes and value is an arbitrary string. 

Persistence is an integral part of BSCE which is a representation of a global state of the network. Persistent state has map-like interface as the heap. The difference is programmer can use arbitrary string as a key.

Code can be executed.
\subsection{Execution scopes}

Launched code is named execution. There are two execution scopes: transaction and smart-contract. If launched code is placed in a transaction it has \textit{transaction scope}. Similarly if launched code is placed in a smart-contract it has \textit{smart-contract scope}.

Execution in transactions scope has not persistent storage but has its own stack and heap. Execution in smart-contacts scope inherits both stack and heap from the execution which launches it. Also it has persistent storage shared between all the executions of the smart-contract.

\subsection{Transaction isolation}

As noted above persistence is an integral part of BSCE. Executions can read and write to the persistent storage. BSCE supports parallel execution of the same smart-contacts. It means concurrent access to the stored data. According to this requirement we need to provide highest level of consistency so transactions is isolated serializable\cite{transaction-isolation}. 

\section{Bytecode}

BVM executes bytecode in the format described below. Every program is a linear sequence of \textit{opcodes}. Any opcode is represented by one byte. Exception is "PUSHX" opcode which is represented by one byte for opcode itself and a word to represent a constant.

First 3 bits of the word encode length. This is the length of the length of the encoded data. For example, $256$ bytes of the data are encoded by the word of $258$ bytes , which are

$$\underbrace{010}_{3~bits}\underbrace{00001~00000000}_{5~bits~+~1~byte} \underbrace{\cdots}_{256~bytes} $$

If the length of the length is 0 the data is encoded by the rest $5$ bits of the byte.

\textbf{Code} & \textbf{Mnemonic} & \textbf{$\Uparrow$} & \textbf{$\Downarrow$} & \textbf{Description} \\
\hline
0x00 & STOP & $0$ & $0$ & Stops current execution. \\
\hline
0x01 & JUMP & $1$ & $0$ & Alters program execution counter to value of first item of the stack. \\
\hline
0x02 & JUMPI & $2$ & $0$ & If value in head of stack is greater than 0 then alters program execution counter to value of second item in the stack.  \\
\hline
0x03 & RUN & $1$ & $0$ & Launches smart-contract from address given in the first item of the stack.  \\
\hline
0x04 & CALL & $1$ & $0$ & Firstly, it pushes current program counter to the separate stack (so called \emph{call stack}). Then it alters program execution counter to the value of the first item of the stack.  \\
\hline
0x05 & RET & $0$ & $0$ & Alters program execution counter to the value of the first item of the call stack (see CALL opcode).  \\
\hline
0x06 & PCALL & $0$ & $0$ & Takes two words by which it is followed. They are address $a$ and the number of parameters $n$, respectively. Then it executes the smart contract with the address $a$ and passes there only $n$ top elements of the stack.  \\
\hline
0x07 & LCALL & $0$ & $0$ & Takes three words by which it is followed. They are address $a$, function $f$ and the number of parameters $n$, respectively. Then it executes the function $f$ of the library (which is a special form of smart contract) with the address $a$ and passes there only $n$ top elements of the stack. \\
